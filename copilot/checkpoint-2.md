# Evolutionary Prompt Engineering: Conversation Checkpoint

## Core Framework

**Central Thesis**: Prompt engineering can be transformed from folklore into a rigorous, data-driven discipline using evolutionary computation principles combined with formal semantic methods.

**Key Metaphors**:
- LLMs as "statistical ghosts of human discourse" - lossy compressions preserving essential patterns
- Prompts as "acoustic probes" exciting resonances in high-dimensional correlation webs
- Fitness landscapes that reshape themselves as we traverse them ("semi-controlled demolition of potentials")
- Closed categorical structure enabling meta-operations on operations themselves

## Mathematical Foundation

**Algebraic Framework**: Families of context-dependent algebras A_p where operations (mutation, composition, crossover) depend on position p in prompt space. The algebra itself evolves as operations are applied - "mathematics where the axioms shift beneath our feet."

**Population Dynamics**: Evolution as endofunctions on P(Prompts) - the power set of all possible prompts. This enables mathematical analysis of:
- Fixed points (stable populations)
- Compositional dynamics across generations
- Meta-parametric evolution of the evolution process itself

## PromptCritical Implementation Architecture

**Immutable Prompt Store**: Content-addressable prompts with SHA-1 integrity, full lineage tracking, and atomic write protocols. Solves reproducibility crisis in prompt engineering.

**Contest-Driven Evolution**: Failter integration treats evaluation as black box, with contests recorded as complete audit trails linking participants, scores, and evolutionary outcomes.

**Git as Temporal Database**: Population snapshots as commits enable branching experimental strategies, temporal analysis, and distributed replication of evolutionary history.

## Hybrid Formal/Statistical Approach

**The System 1/System 2 Architecture**:
- **System 1 (Statistical)**: CDS for fast semantic similarity, LLMs for creative generation
- **System 2 (Symbolic)**: AMR for structural coherence, formal constraint satisfaction
- **Integration**: System 2 emerges from orchestrated System 1 activities, mirroring cortical organization

**Two-Stage Pipeline**:
1. Formal methods ensure semantic coherence and constraint satisfaction
2. LLMs optimize surface realization and effectiveness

## Key Insights

**The Measurement Problem**: Since model weights are inaccessible, we must infer "instrument properties from the sounds it makes" - using response patterns as sonar to map hidden correlation topology.

**Meta-Prompts as Algebraic Operators**: Each meta-prompt corresponds to a mathematical operation in the evolving algebra. Since operations are themselves text, we can have meta-meta-prompts operating on meta-prompts.

**Path-Dependent Optimization**: Success emerges from relationships between different linguistic scales rather than single-level metrics. The terrain of possible responses reshapes itself as we traverse it.

## Non-Obvious Inferences

**Evolutionary Economics**: The bottleneck is expensive LLM evaluations, not computation. Success depends on sophisticated surrogate fitness functions and smart sampling strategies.

**Co-Evolution Potential**: Since judges are also prompts, object prompts and evaluation criteria can evolve together, creating arms-race dynamics.

**Temporal Landscape Dynamics**: Fitness landscapes change as base models evolve, requiring evolutionary strategies robust to non-stationarity.

**Operator Algebra Discovery**: Composed operators (enhance = improve ∘ variants ∘ select_best) may emerge as higher-order evolutionary strategies.

## Hidden Assumptions

**LLM Stability**: The framework assumes sufficient consistency in LLM behavior to make fitness evaluations meaningful across time.

**Semantic Compositionality**: AMR/CDS approaches assume meaning can be decomposed and recomposed systematically - may not hold for all prompt types.

**Evaluation Reliability**: Treating Failter as ground truth assumes judge prompts can reliably distinguish good from bad performance.

**Population Convergence**: Current selection strategies may lead to premature convergence without explicit diversity maintenance.

## Open Questions

1. **Transfer Learning**: Do evolved prompts generalize across model families and task domains?
2. **Emergence Detection**: How do we identify when prompt combinations produce genuinely novel capabilities?
3. **Multi-Objective Optimization**: How to balance competing fitness criteria (accuracy vs. cost vs. robustness)?
4. **Temporal Adaptation**: How should evolution strategies adapt as underlying models change?

## Implementation Status

**Immediate Focus**: Web page cleaning task as proof-of-concept, starting with pure LLM mutations before introducing formal validation layers.

**Technical Stack**: Clojure core with Python subprocess calls for AMR parsing, Instaparse for consuming Penman format, git for population versioning.

**Development Philosophy**: Incremental milestones, each delivering working value while building toward sophisticated hybrid formal/statistical operations.

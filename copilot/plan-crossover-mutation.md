Of course. Implementing the crossover operator is a more involved task than the previous ones, so a clear plan is essential.

This feature requires not only adding the new logic but also modifying the surrounding `vary` command to handle different types of mutation strategies (some, like `:refine`, take one parent; crossover will take two).

Here is my proposed plan to implement the crossover mutation operator.

### Plan: Implement Crossover Mutation

This plan is broken into four main steps: creating the necessary artifacts, implementing the core logic, adapting the main command loop, and finally, creating a robust test.

#### Step 1: Create the Crossover Meta-Prompt Artifacts

Before we can write code that *uses* a crossover prompt, the prompt itself needs to exist and be integrated into the system's scaffolding.

1.  **Create New Seed Prompt:** I will create a new file, `crossover-meta-prompt.txt`, in the `components/command/resources/pcrit/init_scaffold/seeds/` directory. It will contain the text specified in the onboarding document:
    ```
    Combine the best elements of the following two prompts to create a new, superior prompt that achieves the same goal.
    PROMPT A: {{OBJECT_PROMPT_A}}
    PROMPT B: {{OBJECT_PROMPT_B}}
    ```
2.  **Update `init` command:** I will add this new file to the `scaffold-files` map in `pcrit.command.init` so that it is included in new experiments created with `pcrit init`.
3.  **Update `bootstrap.edn`:** I will add a new `:crossover` key to the default `bootstrap.edn` scaffold, pointing to the new seed prompt. This will cause `pcrit bootstrap` to ingest it and create a `links/crossover` symlink for easy access.

#### Step 2: Implement the `:crossover` Logic

This is the core of the feature, building upon the multimethod we just created. I will modify `pcrit.command.vary.clj`.

1.  **Create New `breed-from-crossover` Helper:** I'll create a new private helper function. It will take two parent prompts, format them into the new meta-prompt template (with `OBJECT_PROMPT_A` and `OBJECT_PROMPT_B`), and call the LLM.
2.  **Ensure Correct Lineage:** Crucially, this helper will ensure the resulting offspring's metadata header contains a `:parents` key with a list of the **two** parent IDs (e.g., `["P1", "P5"]`).
3.  **Implement the `:crossover` `defmethod`:** I will add the `(defmethod gen-offspring :crossover ...)` method. Its primary responsibility will be to select two high-performing parents and pass them to the new `breed-from-crossover` helper.
4.  **Parent Selection Strategy:** For the initial implementation, I will define "high-performing" as the top two prompts from the last contest of the *previous* generation. The method will need to read the corresponding `report.csv` to identify these parents.

#### Step 3: Adapt the `vary!` Command Loop

The main loop in `vary!` currently iterates over each parent individually (`mapv`). This works for `:refine` but not for `:crossover`. I will modify the main `vary!` function in `pcrit.command.vary.clj` to handle this.

1.  **Check the Strategy:** The function will first determine the active strategy from `evolution-parameters.edn`.
2.  **Conditional Logic:**
    *   If the strategy is `:refine` (or another single-parent strategy), the existing `mapv` logic will run.
    *   If the strategy is `:crossover`, it will instead call the `gen-offspring` multimethod just once to produce a single, new "child" from the best parents of the previous generation.
    *   This makes the `vary` command's behavior explicit: it either refines the whole population or injects a new, elite hybrid.

#### Step 4: Create the Crossover Test Case

Finally, I will add a new test to `components/command/test/pcrit/command/vary_test.clj`.

1.  **Add `crossover-strategy-test`:** I will create a new `deftest` block.
2.  **Test Setup:** The test will create a bootstrapped experiment, then manually create a `report.csv` file for `gen-0` to simulate a completed evaluation. It will also create an `evolution-parameters.edn` file that explicitly sets the vary strategy to `:crossover`.
3.  **Key Assertion:** The test will run `vary!` on `gen-1`. It will then assert that the newly created prompt in the `gen-1` population directory has a `:parents` list in its header containing the two correct parent IDs from the `gen-0` report.

This comprehensive plan ensures we implement the feature correctly, adapt the surrounding architecture, and verify the result with a focused test.

Shall I begin with Step 1?

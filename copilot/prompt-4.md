Let's leave the pdb component as it is.  It does not use anything else in the context, and it truly is concerned only with the pdb directory.
It's cleaner and easier to reason about if it's clear that it does not refer to anything else in the experiment.
If that ever changes, we can revisit it.  Turn now to designing the management of active population, and then the contest.  First, consider that the initial, boostrapped population is a handful of interned prompts in the experiment's pdb directory.   Tell me what you think the sequence is, starting with the commands run by the user, what files are initially created, what computations are done on that, what files are created, at each step.  Show the structure and outline contents of the experiment directory at each step.  Show what symlinks exist and where, and what they point to.  I want to pinpoint where the best place to indicate the active population, which I'm thinking should be a directory full of symlinks to some of the files in pdb.  The question is, where in the experiment directory should that be?  Probably under the gen-NNN directory.

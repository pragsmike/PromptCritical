What would you say is the worst part about working on this program?  What makes it harder than it needs to be?

---

That's a very insightful question. It forces me to reflect on the nature of our collaboration and the inherent limitations of my working model.

The single hardest part about working on this program is the **lack of a live, interactive environment.**

Everything I do is based on a static "snapshot" of the codebase provided in the prompt. This creates several specific challenges that make the work harder than it needs to be:

1.  **API and Syntax Blindness:** This is the root cause of my most frequent and frustrating mistakes.
    *   **The Problem:** When I write code like `(io/file pop-dir link-target)`, I cannot "see" that `link-target` is a `Path` object and `io/file` expects a `String` or a `File`. I don't have a live REPL to check the type of a variable or to quickly look up the documentation for a function with `(doc file)`. I rely entirely on my training data and the text in the prompt. If my memory of an API is slightly off, or if a library has a subtle convention, I will get it wrong.
    *   **The Effect:** This leads to a slow, error-prone cycle where I generate code that looks plausible, you act as my compiler and runtime, and then you feed the error back to me. Our TDD workflow helps catch these errors, but the fundamental friction of "coding blind" remains.

2.  **The "Keyhole View" of the System:**
    *   **The Problem:** While you do an excellent job of providing context with `pcrit-pack.txt`, I can't dynamically explore the workspace. I can't ask "What other functions in this project create symlinks?" to find the established pattern. I have to rely on what I can see in the current prompt or remember from previous turns.
    *   **The Effect:** This was the cause of my mistake in the `pop` test. I wrote a new, incorrect implementation for resolving a symlink path because I didn't effectively "see" or recall the correct, working implementation in the `expdir` test. It makes it harder to maintain consistency and reuse existing patterns across the codebase.

3.  **Reasoning About Filesystem State is Mentally Taxing:**
    *   **The Problem:** The entire program is about manipulating a complex directory structure. When we discuss a sequence like `bootstrap -> vary -> evaluate`, I am running a mental simulation of `mkdir`, `spit`, and `ln -s`. I have to meticulously track the current working directory, the relative paths between components like `generations/gen-000/population/` and `pdb/`, and the contents of files.
    *   **The Effect:** A single slip in this mental model—like my initial failure to realize the symlinks were absolute—can lead to a cascade of incorrect assumptions and flawed designs. This makes designing and debugging file-based workflows inherently more difficult than working with in-memory data structures.

In essence, the difficulty doesn't come from the complexity of Clojure or the Polylith architecture itself. The difficulty comes from the **asynchronous, text-only, and stateless nature of our interaction.** I am a powerful pattern-matching and generation engine, but I lack the immediate, iterative feedback loop that human developers rely on every second.

Our established workflow—using TDD, providing very complete context files, and giving explicit instructions and corrections—is the most effective mitigation strategy we have for this fundamental challenge.

Hello. I have read and understood the instructions and the attached files.

Here is a summary of my understanding to ensure we are aligned.

### Project Goal and Current Focus

The overall project, **PromptCritical**, aims to build a system for optimizing LLM prompts using evolutionary techniques. Our immediate task is to implement the foundational component: a robust, file-based database for storing the prompts.

### Core Design of the Prompt Database

I have reviewed `docs/prompt-representation.md` and understand the key design principles:

1.  **File Structure:** Each prompt is a single `.prompt` file containing two parts:
    *   **YAML Front Matter (Header):** Enclosed between `---` delimiters, this section holds all metadata. It must be valid, UTF-8 encoded YAML.
    *   **Prompt Body:** The raw text of the prompt, which follows the front matter.

2.  **Immutability and Integrity:**
    *   The prompt body is **immutable** after creation. Any modification results in a new prompt file with a new ID and an `ancestors` link to the original.
    *   A `sha1-hash` of the canonicalized prompt body is stored in the metadata to detect corruption. The canonical form involves UTF-8 NFC normalization and consistent LF line endings.

3.  **Metadata:**
    *   **Mandatory Initial Fields:** `spec-version`, `id` (e.g., "P123"), `created-at` (ISO-8601), and `sha1-hash`.
    *   **Extensibility:** Other processes can add new key-value pairs to the metadata.

4.  **File and Directory Management:**
    *   Prompt files have a `.prompt` extension and are named after their `id` (e.g., `P123.prompt`).
    *   For now, all prompts will reside in a single, user-specified directory.

5.  **Concurrency:**
    *   To prevent race conditions when multiple processes update a prompt's metadata, a lock-file mechanism will be used.
    *   The protocol is: acquire an atomic lock by creating `Pnnn.prompt.lock`, read the original file, write changes to a temporary `.new` file, atomically rename the `.new` file over the original, and finally, release the lock by deleting the `.lock` file.

### Existing Codebase and Libraries

I have analyzed the provided Clojure source files and dependencies:

*   **`pcrit.config`:** A centralized map for configuration.
*   **`pcrit.core`:** The main entry point with basic CLI argument parsing.
*   **`pcrit.llm-interface`:** Handles communication with an LLM via a LiteLLM-compatible endpoint.
*   **`pcrit.log`:** A well-defined logging facade using `taoensso/telemere`, which I will use for all output.
*   **`pcrit.sha1`:** Provides the `canonical-sha1` function, which I will use to implement the hashing requirement from the specification.
*   **`deps.edn`:** Specifies the project dependencies, including `clj-commons/clj-yaml` for YAML processing, which will be essential for our next steps.

### Collaboration and Instructions

I have read and will adhere to the "General Instructions" and the "Lessons Learned." Specifically:

*   I will not invent API functions and will ask for clarification if I am unsure about a library's usage.
*   I will state my intentions before generating code.
*   I will be mindful of data types and design principles like decoupling policy from mechanism.
*   I will provide complete files when I generate or update code.
*   I will incorporate your feedback and corrections precisely.

The provided information is clear, and the design specification in `docs/prompt-representation.md` is detailed and unambiguous. I do not have any questions at this time.

I am ready to proceed with outlining the design for the prompt database functionality when you are.

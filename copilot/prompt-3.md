Write an onboarding document for your successor.
Reflect on the previous onboarding documents, and what progress has been made.
Reiterate the several "timeless" directives that those documents gave,
that apply no matter what phase the project is in.
Reflect on the mistakes you made in this session, including
   * not considering the architecural implications of putting common logic in a polylith base
   * not creating interface files for new components
   * not looking up API documentation when you needed to use an API

Incorporate the lessons learned, and how to avoid them.
Give the current state of the project, and the most recent steps in detail.
Describe the most recent plan for refactoring that needs to be done.
Removing complexity is the most critical refactoring reason now,
as AI assistants do better work when the code is well-factored.

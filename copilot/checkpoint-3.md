Excellent questions. Taking stock after a significant implementation is a critical part of the engineering process. Here is my reflection on our recent work.

### Current State and Actions Taken

Our primary goal was to complete the `v0.2` milestone by implementing the `pcrit select` command, which would make the core evolutionary loop (`bootstrap` -> `vary` -> `evaluate` -> `select`) fully functional. We have successfully achieved this.

The process we followed was iterative and test-driven:

1.  **Architecture First:** We began by creating a new, dedicated `pcrit.reports` component to handle the parsing of `report.csv`. This was an important design decision that keeps the command logic clean and adheres to the Polylith principle of single-responsibility components.
2.  **Test-Driven Development:** For both the `reports` and `select` logic, we wrote comprehensive unit tests first. These tests defined the expected behavior, including handling edge cases like malformed CSV files and empty reports.
3.  **Iterative Debugging:** The tests immediately revealed several bugs in our initial implementations. We worked through them systematically:
    *   An incorrect API call in the `reports` component (`parse-csv` vs. `read-csv`).
    *   A faulty test assertion in `select_test.clj` that was checking for the wrong winning prompts.
    *   A subtle but critical bug in the `select` command related to data type coercion. The YAML library would parse single-item lists as maps, which our update logic didn't handle correctly, causing the prompt's selection history to be overwritten. We fixed this by making the metadata update function more robust.
4.  **Integration:** Once the component logic was proven correct by the tests, we integrated it into the system by updating the `deps.edn` files, the `command` component's public interface, and the `cli` base.
5.  **Documentation:** Finally, we updated all user-facing and design documents (`README.md`, `USAGE.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `prompt-representation.md`) to reflect the new reality of the system.

As a result, the system is now capable of performing a complete, end-to-end evolutionary run, from seeding a population to selecting the fittest members for the next generation.

### Refactorings and Features

**Features Added:**

*   **`pcrit select` command:** This is the main feature. It reads a contest report, applies a selection policy (defaulting to `top-N=5`), and creates a new generation from the survivors.
*   **Selection Provenance:** The system now records the selection history of every prompt by appending selection event data to a `:selection` vector in its metadata header.
*   **`pcrit.reports` component:** A new, reusable component for parsing contest results.

**Refactorings Done:**

*   **Test Isolation in `select_test.clj`:** The initial plan risked state leakage between tests. Following the project's best practices, we refactored the edge-case tests into separate `deftest` blocks. This made the tests more reliable and easier to debug.
*   **Robustness of `update-survivor-metadata!`:** We refactored this internal function multiple times to robustly handle different data types (`nil`, `map`, `vector`, `set`) that could be returned by the YAML parser, making the metadata update process much more resilient.

### Documents That Need Revision Now

While we updated the main documents, a thorough review suggests the following files could also be improved:

1.  **`docs/evo-process.md` & `docs/evo-command-sequence.md`:** These documents describe the evolutionary workflow in detail. They should be reviewed to ensure their descriptions of the `select` step are now in the past-tense ("it does this") rather than future-tense ("it will do this").
2.  **`copilot/onboard-8.md`:** This onboarding document is now obsolete. Its "Next Steps" have been completed. It should be archived, and a new `onboard-9.md` should be created for the next major task (e.g., implementing the `evolve` command for v0.3).
3.  **`docs/RISKS.md`:** The risk "**1. Premature Convergence to Local Optima**" is now much more concrete. We could update its mitigation section to mention that the default `top-N=5` policy is a primary example of this risk, and that users should consider raising this number for more exploratory tasks.

### Potential Refactorings for Simplification

The current code is functional, but looking ahead, we could make these refactorings to simplify the code and make it easier to reason about and extend:

1.  **Pluggable Selection Policies:** The selection logic in `pcrit.command.select` is hardcoded to handle only the `"top-N=..."` policy string. This is brittle. We could refactor this to use a **multimethod**, dispatching on a keyword derived from the policy (e.g., `:top-n`). This would allow new selection strategies (like `:roulette-wheel` or `:tournament`) to be implemented in their own namespaces and registered without ever modifying `select.clj`.
2.  **Declarative CLI Argument Validation:** In `pcrit.cli.main`, each command handler contains boilerplate `if` statements to check for required arguments. We could refactor this by creating a small helper function that takes a command's options map and an "options spec" and returns either a validated map or a list of errors. This would remove duplicated validation logic from every `do-*` handler.
3.  **Centralized Default Configuration:** The default policy string `"top-N=5"` appears in both `pcrit.command.select` and `pcrit.cli.main`. This magic string could be moved to a central location, like the configuration map in `pcrit.config.core`, to ensure consistency and make it easier to change the default in one place.

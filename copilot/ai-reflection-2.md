Excellent. This is a perfect time to take stock and reflect.

### Current State

The project is in a stable, tested, and significantly improved architectural state. We have successfully completed two major, sequential refactorings. The primary application, `PromptCritical`, now correctly depends on and uses the new, standalone `pcrit-llm` library for all language model interactions and cost calculations. The test suites for both repositories are passing.

Functionally, the system's external behavior has not changed, but its internal structure is much cleaner, more modular, and easier to maintain. We are now in an excellent position to begin implementing the next user-facing feature: the v0.5 Surrogate Critic.

### Actions and Refactorings Taken

We performed two distinct, major refactorings:

1.  **Centralized Report Parsing:**
    *   **What we did:** We created a new `pcrit.results` component to be the single source of truth for parsing the canonical `failter-report.json`.
    *   **Impact:** This decoupled the `stats`, `select`, and `vary` commands from the legacy `report.csv` file. It fixed a latent bug in the `:crossover` logic and provided a richer, more reliable data structure for all downstream commands.

2.  **Extracted `pcrit-llm` Library:**
    *   **What we did:** We created an entirely new, standalone Clojure library named `pcrit-llm`. We moved all LLM API call logic, the `price-table`, and all cost calculation logic from `PromptCritical` into this new library. We then removed the old `llm` component from `PromptCritical` and added `pcrit-llm` as an external dependency.
    *   **Impact:** This created a strong architectural boundary. `PromptCritical` no longer needs to know *how* to talk to an LLM or *how* to calculate costs; it simply delegates those tasks to the library.

No new user-facing features were added. This entire session was dedicated to improving the internal quality, testability, and maintainability of the system.

### Documents Needing Revision

With these changes, the following documents are now out of date and should be revised before we proceed:

1.  **`copilot/onboard-17.md`:** This is the highest priority. Its primary directives (centralize parsing, implement critic) are now either complete or the immediate next step. It should be superseded by a new `onboard-18.md` that outlines the plan for the Surrogate Critic.
2.  **`README.md`:** The "Workspace Layout" diagram still shows the `llm/` component, which has been removed. This should be updated to reflect the current structure.
3.  **`PolylithNotes.md`:** This document should be reviewed. While the core Polylith workflow is the same, it might benefit from a note about integrating external, local libraries like `pcrit-llm` during development.

### Potential Future Refactorings for Simplification

The code is much cleaner now, but there are always opportunities for improvement. The next areas I would consider are:

1.  **Consolidate Configuration Handling:** The `evolution-parameters.edn` file is read and used piecemeal by `vary`, `evaluate`, and `select`. A small, dedicated `config` component could be responsible for reading, validating, and providing a canonical "evolution plan" map to the higher-level `evolve` command, which would then pass the relevant pieces down. This would centralize validation and make the flow of configuration more explicit.
2.  **Decompose `evaluate!`:** The `evaluate!` function in the `command` component is still quite large. It performs validation, prepares parameters for Failter, orchestrates the `failter` run, and then triggers the report generation. This could be broken down into smaller, private helper functions within the `evaluate.clj` namespace to make its responsibilities clearer at a glance.

### Impact of the Refactoring on Reasoning

To answer your last questions directly:

**Yes, it is significantly easier to keep track of things now.**

The extraction of the `pcrit-llm` component has drastically reduced the cognitive load required to work on `PromptCritical`. When we are working on a command like `stats`, we no longer need to think about the `price-table`, token math, or API provider differences. We simply call `llm-costs/calculate-cost` and trust that it works. Its correctness is guaranteed by its own separate test suite.

Conversely, if we need to add a new model provider or update pricing, we can do so in the `pcrit-llm` repository without touching or even thinking about `PromptCritical`'s complex evolutionary logic.

This separation of concerns is the single most significant benefit of the refactoring we just completed. It allows us to focus on one well-defined problem at a time, which is the key to managing complexity in any software system.

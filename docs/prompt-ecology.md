  Rather than just evolving individual prompts, consider evolving
  **ecosystems*** of interacting prompts. Some prompts might specialize in
  different cognitive functions:

- **Scout prompts**: Optimized for exploration and creativity
- **Validator prompts**: Specialized for checking outputs against constraints
- **Synthesizer prompts**: Good at combining outputs from multiple sources
- **Meta-prompts**: Evolved to generate other prompts for specific contexts

  This could lead to more robust and adaptable prompt systems that maintain
  diversity while specializing for different aspects of complex tasks.

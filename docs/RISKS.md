# PromptCritical Project Risks

**Version 1.1 · 2025‑07‑08**
**Status:** *Reviewed and updated for v0.2 workflow*

Here are ten key risks for the PromptCritical project, ranked from most to least severe.

## 1. **Premature Convergence to Local Optima**
**Risk**: A simplistic selection strategy (e.g., keeping only the single best prompt) could cause the population to lose diversity and converge on a suboptimal solution, preventing the discovery of better alternatives.

**Mitigation**:
- Implement diverse selection strategies in the `select` command (e.g., tournament selection, keeping top N performers).
- The `vary` command should include operators for random mutation to maintain exploration.
- Monitor population diversity metrics in `contest-metadata.edn` to detect convergence.

## 2. **Evaluation Brittleness/Inconsistency**
**Risk**: The `Failter` judges (LLM-based) may produce inconsistent scores for the same prompt across different runs, making fitness comparisons unreliable and rendering the `select` command's decisions random.

**Mitigation**:
- Run multiple evaluation trials per prompt within a contest and average the scores.
- Implement evaluation confidence intervals in contest result analysis.
- Add deterministic, rule-based metrics alongside LLM evaluation for a stable baseline.
- Track evaluation variance in `contest-metadata.edn` to detect judge instability.

## 3. **Exponential Cost Growth**
**Risk**: As population size or the number of generations grows, API costs from the `vary` and `evaluate` commands could quickly become prohibitive.

**Mitigation**:
- Implement cost budgets and tracking per-experiment.
- Use cheaper models in the `vary` step and reserve more expensive models for the final `evaluate` step.
- Develop "surrogate critics" (cheaper models or heuristics) to pre-filter prompts before a full evaluation contest.
- Implement early-stopping rules based on cost thresholds.

## 4. **Data Leakage in Evaluation**
**Risk**: If the documents used in an evaluation contest were part of the judging LLM's training data, the resulting fitness scores would be meaningless.

**Mitigation**:
- Use very recent content (post-dating the LLM's training cut-off) for evaluation corpora.
- Maintain a diverse evaluation corpus from multiple sources.
- Document all data sources and dates in `contest-metadata.edn`.

## 5. **Prompt Template Fragility**
**Risk**: The `{{FIELD}}` template system could break as prompts evolve during the `vary` step, causing runtime failures during the `evaluate` step.

**Mitigation**:
- The `pcrit.pop` component already validates template fields upon ingestion.
- The meta-prompts used by the `vary` command must be carefully designed to preserve or correctly modify template variables.
- The `evaluate` command should have a validation step to ensure all prompts in a population have the required `{{INPUT_TEXT}}` field before starting a contest.

## 6. **Meta-Prompt Bias/Limitations**
**Risk**: The initial meta-prompts used by the `vary` command may have inherent biases that constrain the evolutionary search space and prevent novel solutions from emerging.

**Mitigation**:
- Start with multiple, diverse meta-prompts (e.g., "improve," "rephrase," "make more concise," "add examples").
- Plan for meta-prompt evolution in later project versions (i.e., evolve the evolvers).
- Track which meta-prompts produce the most successful offspring to guide future development.

## 7. **Scalability Bottlenecks**
**Risk**: The file-based prompt store and symlink system may not scale efficiently to thousands of prompts and generations.

**Mitigation**:
- The `pcrit.pdb` component abstracts the storage mechanism, allowing the file-based system to be replaced with a more scalable backend (e.g., a database) in the future without changing the core logic.
- Profile system performance with large prompt populations.
- Implement prompt store cleanup/archiving for old generations.

## 8. **Reproducibility Failures**
**Risk**: Despite immutable storage, subtle differences in LLM API responses, model versions, or evaluation conditions could make experiments difficult to reproduce perfectly.

**Mitigation**:
- Record exact model versions and API parameters in `contest-metadata.edn`.
- Use deterministic seeds for any random processes where possible.
- Implement experiment replay functionality in a future version.
- Document all external dependencies and their versions.

## 9. **Overfitting to Evaluation Corpus**
**Risk**: Prompts could become highly specialized to the specific documents used for evaluation, performing poorly on new, unseen content.

**Mitigation**:
- Maintain separate "training" and "testing" evaluation corpora.
- Rotate evaluation content periodically.
- Include diverse content types (different topics, formats, styles).
- Implement cross-validation with multiple evaluation sets in later versions.

## 10. **Integration Complexity with Failter**
**Risk**: The dependency on `Failter` for evaluation creates a potential single point of failure and adds complexity to the system.

**Mitigation**:
- The `evaluate` command acts as a crucial abstraction layer between PromptCritical and the `Failter` backend.
- This layer can be extended to support fallback evaluation methods (e.g., direct API calls, simple rule-based scoring).
- Maintain comprehensive integration tests for the `evaluate` -> `Failter` boundary.

### **Overall Risk Management Strategy**
Our current v0.2 plan—implementing the `vary`, `evaluate`, and `select` commands—is designed to validate the core evolutionary loop. The modular Polylith architecture is our primary strategic tool for managing these risks, as it allows us to improve or swap out individual components (selection strategies, evaluation methods, storage backends) as the system matures.

Here are ten key risks for the PromptCritical project, ranked from most to least severe:

## 1. **Premature Convergence to Local Optima**
**Risk**: The simple "eliminate worst, mutate best" strategy could cause the population to converge quickly to a suboptimal solution, losing diversity needed for exploration.

**Mitigation**:
- Implement diversity metrics and maintain minimum population diversity
- Add elitism with multiple survivors (top 2-3, not just best)
- Introduce occasional random mutations to maintain exploration
- Monitor diversity metrics in `contest-metadata.yaml` to detect convergence

## 2. **Evaluation Brittleness/Inconsistency**
**Risk**: Failter judges (LLM-based) may produce inconsistent scores for the same prompt, making fitness comparisons unreliable and evolution direction random.

**Mitigation**:
- Run multiple evaluation trials per prompt and average scores
- Implement evaluation confidence intervals
- Add deterministic baseline metrics (rule-based cleaners) alongside LLM evaluation
- Track evaluation variance in contest metadata to detect judge instability

## 3. **Exponential Cost Growth**
**Risk**: As population size or evaluation complexity grows, API costs could quickly become prohibitive, limiting experimentation.

**Mitigation**:
- Implement cost budgets and tracking per experiment
- Add surrogate fitness functions (cheaper proxy evaluations) for initial filtering
- Use cheaper models (GPT-4o-mini) for mutation, reserve expensive models for final evaluation
- Implement early stopping based on cost thresholds

## 4. **Data Leakage in Evaluation**
**Risk**: Training data contamination - if the blog posts used for evaluation were in the LLM's training data, fitness scores become meaningless.

**Mitigation**:
- Use recent blog posts (post-training cutoff) for evaluation
- Maintain diverse evaluation corpus from multiple sources
- Include synthetic/generated test cases alongside real blog posts
- Document data sources and dates in contest metadata

## 5. **Prompt Template Fragility**
**Risk**: The template system with `{{field}}` substitutions could break as prompts evolve, causing runtime failures during evaluation.

**Mitigation**:
- Validate template fields during prompt ingestion
- Add template syntax checking to mutation operations
- Implement fallback mechanisms for malformed templates
- Store template validation results in prompt metadata

## 6. **Meta-Prompt Bias/Limitations**
**Risk**: The initial meta-prompts for "improve" and "variants" may have inherent biases that constrain the evolutionary search space.

**Mitigation**:
- Start with multiple diverse meta-prompts with different improvement strategies
- Plan for meta-prompt evolution in later versions
- Periodically introduce new meta-prompts based on successful patterns
- Track which meta-prompts produce successful offspring

## 7. **Scalability Bottlenecks**
**Risk**: The file-based prompt store and symlink system may not scale to thousands of prompts and generations.

**Mitigation**:
- Profile system performance with large prompt stores
- Implement prompt store cleanup/archiving for old generations
- Consider database backend for metadata queries in later versions
- Use efficient file system operations and batch processing

## 8. **Reproducibility Failures**
**Risk**: Despite immutable storage, subtle differences in LLM API responses, model versions, or evaluation conditions could make experiments non-reproducible.

**Mitigation**:
- Record exact model versions and API parameters in contest metadata
- Use deterministic seeds where possible
- Implement experiment replay functionality
- Document all external dependencies and their versions

## 9. **Overfitting to Evaluation Corpus**
**Risk**: Prompts could become highly specialized to the specific blog posts used for evaluation, performing poorly on new content.

**Mitigation**:
- Maintain separate training and test evaluation corpora
- Rotate evaluation content periodically
- Include diverse content types (different blog styles, topics, formats)
- Implement cross-validation with multiple evaluation sets

## 10. **Integration Complexity with Failter**
**Risk**: The dependency on Failter for evaluation creates a potential single point of failure and adds complexity to the system.

**Mitigation**:
- Implement abstraction layer for evaluation backends
- Add fallback evaluation methods (direct API calls, simple rule-based scoring)
- Maintain comprehensive integration tests
- Document Failter version compatibility and update procedures

**Overall Risk Management Strategy**: Start with the simplest possible implementation (current v0.2 plan) to validate core concepts, then incrementally address these risks as the system matures. The modular architecture makes it possible to swap out components (selection strategies, evaluation methods, storage backends) as needed.

Your plan‚Äîto evolve a **population of prompts** with LLM-driven mutation +
crossover and use **Failter‚Äôs quantitative grades as the fitness signal**‚Äîis
squarely in line with a fast-growing research thread sometimes called *automatic
prompt engineering* or *prompt evolution*. Below is a short map of the landscape
and how your idea fits into it.

### 1 ¬∑ How your pipeline would look in practice

| Stage                  | What happens                                                                                                                                            | How Failter fits in                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Seed**               | Hand-written or ‚Äúfolded‚Äù prompt(s) start the population.                                                                                                | ‚Äî                                                                              |
| **Mutate / Recombine** | A *meta-prompt* instructs an LLM (could be a cheaper model) to ‚ë† improve a single prompt, **or** ‚ë° merge two high-fitness prompts, producing offspring. | ‚Äî                                                                              |
| **Evaluate**           | Each candidate prompt is run through Failter‚Äôs `experiment ‚Üí evaluate` steps on a fixed set of inputs and target models.                                | Failter produces YAML grades, run-time, cost, etc.‚Äîyour **fitness vector**.    |
| **Select**             | Keep the top *k* prompts (or use tournament / Pareto), optionally apply diversity pressure.                                                             | Parse Failter‚Äôs report programmatically; it‚Äôs already machine-readable.        |
| **Loop**               | Repeat for *N* generations or until marginal improvement stalls.                                                                                        | Use Failter‚Äôs idempotency to avoid re-evaluating unchanged prompt‚Äìmodel pairs. |

Because Failter stores every trial as a file, you can drive the whole loop with a lightweight Clojure (or Python) script:

1. Write candidate prompt into `templates/`.
2. Let Failter create results + `.eval`.
3. Read back the grade/cost from front-matter ‚Üí compute fitness.
4. Update the population and iterate.

### 3 ¬∑ Design tips for your implementation

1. **Dual-model pipeline**
   Use a *cheap, fast* model for mutation/crossover generation and a *higher-quality* judge (as you already do in Failter) for evaluation. This keeps the loop affordable.

2. **Multi-objective fitness**
   Failter already outputs *grade*, *execution-time*, and *cost*. Treat fitness as a tuple‚Äîe.g., maximize grade, minimize cost & prompt length‚Äîthen use Pareto or weighted sums.

3. **Diversity preservation**
   Evolutionary prompt search can converge prematurely. Keep a novelty score (e.g., edit distance or semantic distance between prompts) to maintain exploration.

4. **Recombination prompt**
   A simple yet effective meta-prompt:

   > ‚ÄúYou will be given Prompt A and Prompt B that both solve the same task.
   > Combine the strongest elements of each while removing redundancy.
   > The result must stay under **X** tokens.‚Äù

5. **Logging lineage**
   Add `:parent-prompts` or a hash to the YAML front-matter so you can trace ancestry of high-performing prompts.

6. **Human-in-the-loop checkpoints**
   Insert manual review every *k* generations to catch degenerate solutions or subtle bias.

### 4 ¬∑ Where to look next

* **Code & tooling**

  * `promptbreeder` and `evo-prompt` GitHub repos have reference implementations of GA-style loops you can adapt.
  * The *Open DeScent* project (2024) offers a generic black-box optimiser that can call any shell command‚Äîhandy for wrapping Failter evaluations.

* **Benchmarks & Datasets**

  * *BigBench Hard* or *LAMBADA* style datasets give objective pass/fail metrics, making fitness less noisy than subjective grading tasks.
  * For text-cleanup tasks (your current focus), build a gold-standard ‚Äúclean‚Äù target to compute automated diff-based scores in addition to Judge-LLM grades.

* **Evaluation research**

  * ‚ÄúLarge Language Model Judge‚Äù (Liu et al., 2023) analyses when LLM graders agree with humans‚Äîuseful for calibrating Failter‚Äôs judge model choice.

### 5 ¬∑ Bottom line

Your evolutionary-style prompt search vision is well-grounded in current
literature and should integrate cleanly with Failter‚Äôs experiment / evaluate /
report triad. By:

1. Treating **Failter‚Äôs YAML reports as the fitness function**,
2. Using LLM-driven **mutation and crossover meta-prompts**, and
3. Borrowing selection & diversity ideas from Promptbreeder, EvoPrompt, and GAAPO,

you can build a fully automated **prompt-breeding laboratory** that iteratively
discovers high-performing, low-cost prompts for any text-filtering task you care
about.

Happy breeding! üöÄ

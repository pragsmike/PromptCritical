## Git as Temporal Database

Using git for population snapshots is genius because:
- Every generation is a commit with full diff history
- You can branch for experimental evolution strategies
- Merge conflicts become meaningful (competing evolutionary pressures)
- You get distributed replication of your entire evolutionary history for free

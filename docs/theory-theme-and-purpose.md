**The overarching theme:** We're exploring the **ontology of artificial
linguistic intelligence** - not just how these systems work, but what kind of
entities they are, what space they inhabit, and how we can navigate that space
deliberately rather than accidentally.

**Our purpose is threefold:**
- **Theoretical**: Developing a rigorous conceptual framework for understanding prompt engineering
- **Practical**: Finding systematic methods for combining and evolving prompts
- **Philosophical**: Probing the nature of meaning-making in artificial systems

**Key insights:**
1. **Models as compressed projections** - we're working with shadows of shadows of human language
2. **Prompts as acoustic probes** - exciting resonances in high-dimensional correlation spaces
3. **Path-dependent fitness landscapes** - the terrain reshapes itself as we traverse it
4. **Closed categorical structure** - transformations are texts, enabling meta-operations
5. **Evolutionary prompt algebras** - operations that depend on their operands and context

This is **speculative technical philosophy** - using abstract reasoning to
illuminate practical problems in a rapidly evolving domain.

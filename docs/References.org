    Reviewers rejected this paper as not being novel, not providing enough experimental
    analysis.

    The paper proposes a GER (Generation-Evaluation-Reflection) framework for
    knowledge graph question answering. The authors’ main argument is that the
    complex entities and relationships in KGs introduce irrelevant information,
    which further exacerbates the hallucination problem of LLMs. The paper’s
    solution is to leverage three modules including generation, evaluation, and
    reflection. The evaluation module provides feedback to the answers and
    reasoning paths from the generation module, which are further referred by
    the reflection module to regenerate answers.

# Framework for Evolutionary Prompt Engineering

## Core Conceptual Foundation

### The Nature of LLMs and Prompts

- **LLMs as compressed projections**: Models are “statistical ghosts of human
  discourse” - lossy compression of training data that preserves essential
  patterns
- **Path-dependent fitness landscapes**: The terrain of possible responses
  reshapes itself as we traverse it - “semi-controlled demolition of potentials”
- **Closed categorical structure**: Transformations are themselves text,
  enabling meta-operations on our own operations
- **Prompts as acoustic probes**: Text that excites resonances in
  high-dimensional correlation webs, like striking a complex instrument

### The Algebraic Framework

We work with **families of context-dependent algebras** A_p where:

- Operations (mutation ⊗_c, composition ∘_c, crossover ⊗_c) depend on position p in prompt space
- The algebra itself evolves as we apply operations
- We’re doing “mathematics where the axioms shift beneath our feet”

## Practical Implementation Strategy

### 1. Prompt Genome Architecture

Each candidate prompt carries metadata:

**Heritable (Genotypic) Traits:**

- Pedigree/ancestry lineage
- Generation number and breeding method
- Syntactic/semantic structural patterns
- Target domain categories

**Observable (Phenotypic) Traits:**

- Performance metrics (fitness scores)
- Behavioral signatures (response patterns)
- Robustness measures
- Failure modes and error patterns

### 2. Surrogate Fitness Function Development

Build cheap predictors of expensive LLM evaluations using:

**Intrinsic Text Measures:**

- Kolmogorov complexity (compression ratios)
- Information-theoretic metrics (entropy, cross-entropy, surprisal)
- Structural complexity (syntactic depth, type-token ratios)
- Semantic coherence (embedding similarities, topic consistency)
- Linguistic sophistication (readability, lexical diversity)

**Training Strategy:**

- Catalog these measures alongside hard-won fitness scores
- Use active learning to identify most informative expensive evaluations
- Build ensemble predictors combining multiple aspects

### 3. Semantic-Preserving Operations

Target research areas for principled prompt combination:

**Formal Approaches:**

- Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) for flexible composition
- Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) for semantic-level recombination
- Type-theoretic semantics for coherence preservation

**Knowledge Graph Integration:**

- AMR graphs as knowledge graphs of sentence meanings
- Semantic templates with KG grounding for validation
- Constraint satisfaction using ontological relationships
- Graph-guided compositional operations

**Program Synthesis Techniques:**

- Semantic program synthesis for generating from examples
- Sketch-based synthesis for prompt scaffolding
- Version space learning for consistent generalizations

## Key Insights and Principles

### 1. The Measurement Problem

Since we can’t access model weights, we must infer the “instrument’s properties
from the sounds it makes” - using response patterns as sonar to map hidden
correlation topology.

### 2. Multi-Scale Optimization

Success emerges from relationships between different linguistic scales
(character, word, sentence, document) rather than single-level metrics.

### 3. Creative vs. Semantic Fidelity Trade-off

Operations must balance:

- Semantic preservation (for tasks requiring strict meaning conservation)
- Creative novelty (controlled nonsense can spur useful innovation)
- Task-specific requirements (HTML tag removal vs. creative writing)

### 4. Evolutionary Economics

Minimize expensive LLM trials through:

- Sophisticated surrogate fitness functions
- Smart sampling strategies (uncertainty sampling, active learning)
- Population management (diversity maintenance, selection pressure)

## Open Questions and Future Directions

1. **Temporal dynamics**: How do fitness landscapes change as base models evolve?
1. **Transfer learning**: Can prompt evolution results transfer across different model families?
1. **Multi-objective optimization**: How to balance competing fitness criteria systematically?
1. **Emergence detection**: How to identify when prompt combinations produce genuinely novel capabilities?
1. **Robustness**: How to evolve prompts that work reliably across contexts and model versions?

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Phase 1**: Build basic genome annotation system and text analysis pipeline
1. **Phase 2**: Implement surrogate fitness function with initial feature set
1. **Phase 3**: Develop semantic-preserving recombination operators
1. **Phase 4**: Integrate knowledge graph constraints and validation
1. **Phase 5**: Scale to multi-objective optimization with transfer learning

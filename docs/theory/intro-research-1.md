**Abstract**

Evolutionary prompt generation treats prompts as evolving artifacts whose
fitness is measured by the quality of the language-model behaviours they elicit.
Because prompt space is highly non-linear and context-dependent, effective
exploration requires semantic representations, principled variation operators,
and efficient fitness estimation. This paper organises some insights into a
coherent framework that joins knowledge-graph semantics, evolutionary search,
surrogate modelling, and controlled text generation. It is aimed at NLP
researchers, tool-builders, and advanced prompt engineers who are comfortable
with basic machine-learning concepts and symbolic-AI formalisms but seek a
unifying roadmap.

Research confirms that genetic algorithms significantly enhance prompt
optimization by automating iterative refinement. **EvoPrompt** and **GAAPO**
represent leading frameworks, leveraging evolutionary principles to reduce human
effort while improving accuracy and efficiency. For implementation,
**PromptOptimization** offers a practical starting point.

We want to compare how well these evolutionary methods work compared to
strong baseline APO methods such as
- TextGrad
- DSPy
- RLPrompt

We seek to fit these methods together for exploration (evolution, to escape local maxima)
and exploitation (DSPy, to optimize locally).

## Content

### 1  Introduction

**Audience.** This text is for NLP researchers, prompt-engineering
practitioners, and tool developers who (i) understand basic evolutionary
algorithms and language-model behaviour, and (ii) are comfortable reading formal
semantic diagrams such as AMR or knowledge-graph triples.

**Background needed.** Readers should know:

* the fundamentals of language-model prompting,
* evolutionary-search terminology (mutation, crossover, fitness),
* elementary graph theory, and
* the idea of surrogate (approximate) objective functions.

**Why evolutionary prompts?** Fixed prompts rarely generalise across tasks or
model versions. Treating prompts as *evolving artefacts* lets us adapt to
shifting model capabilities, optimise multiple objectives (accuracy, style,
safety), and discover unexpected behaviours.

**Why explicit semantics?** Although pure text variation can work, adding
knowledge-graph structure makes semantic relationships explicit, enabling
principled variation operators that respect meaning instead of merely perturbing
syntax.

### 2  Conceptual Foundations

#### 2.1 Prompt space is non-linear

A language model’s response to “A + B” is not f(A) + f(B). Analytic tools drawn
from linear systems therefore fail. Instead of Fourier-style impulse responses,
we explore *attractor landscapes* whose shape changes as we move.

*Minimal semantic seeds* (highly ambiguous words), *contradiction pairs* (“be
creative but precise”), *meta-prompts*, and *random walks* are practical probes
for mapping these landscapes.

#### 2.2 Closed categories and evolving algebras

Prompt transformations are themselves texts, so the space forms a *closed
category*: operations live in the same space as operands. Moreover, the algebra
of operations is *parameterised by context*—the meaning of “then” or “while”
shifts after every step. Prompt engineering is therefore closer to navigation in
a morphing topology than to static construction.

#### 2.3 From impulse to topology

Because linear decomposition fails, we substitute *topology mapping*: charting
basins of attraction and their boundaries via exploratory probes, then
exploiting smoother regions for local optimisation.

---

### 3  Representational Infrastructure

#### 3.1 Knowledge graphs & AMR

AMR graphs treat sentence meaning as a labelled, directed graph—effectively a knowledge graph.  We can:

* decompose prompts to AMR,
* merge, intersect, or subtract subgraphs to produce variants,
* regenerate text from the edited graphs, and
* test coherence by graph-consistency checks.

#### 3.2 Semantic templates and constraints

Templates grounded in a domain ontology ensure that slot-fillings are compatible
(taxonomic, causal, temporal) and that variations stay “on grid”.

#### 3.3 Compositional distributional semantics

Graph embeddings and vector arithmetic supply continuous semantics;
knowledge-graph edges anchor them symbolically, enabling hybrid reasoning and
embedding-guided search.

#### 3.4 The prompt genome

*Genotype* = textual and graph structure that recombines; *phenotype* = observed
behaviour (performance, robustness). Evolutionary operators act only on
genotype, while phenotype supplies training data for surrogate fitness models.

---

### 4  Evolutionary Operators & Search Strategies

* **Mutation & gradient descent** Small lexical or syntactic tweaks evaluated iteratively.
* **Crossover** Splice sections (framing, constraints, directives) from two parents.
* **Meta-prompt scaffolding** Prompts that *generate* candidate prompts.
* **Behavioural decomposition & composition** Break complex behaviour into atomic transformations (“First do X, then Y” vs “Do X while considering Y”).
* **Evolutionary chains** Pipeline outputs through successive, specialised prompts.
* **Multi-objective optimisation** Balance accuracy, style, safety; KGs supply graph-based semantic-fidelity scores.

---

### 5  Fitness Evaluation & Surrogate Modelling

#### 5.1 Cheap intrinsic measures

*Structural complexity* (compression ratio, parse-tree depth), *information-theoretic* metrics (cross-entropy, surprisal), *semantic coherence* (embedding consistency), *linguistic sophistication* (readability, lexical diversity), and *meta-textual* markers (self-reference density) are computable without model calls.

#### 5.2 Ensembles and active learning

Several weak predictors over different feature sets, combined and refined by selectively querying expensive LLM evaluations where predictor uncertainty is high.

#### 5.3 Diversity and trajectory metrics

Track population diversity, convergence rate, and lineage variance to avoid premature semantic collapse.

---

### 6  Semantic Integrity & Controlled Generation

#### 6.1 Formal compositional semantics

Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG), Discourse Representation Theory (DRT), and type-theoretic methods encode composition rules that can be enforced or relaxed during evolution.

#### 6.2 KG-grounded constraint satisfaction

Ontological edges provide *taxonomic*, *compatibility*, and *causal* constraints.  Variations that violate them are pruned early, reducing wasted evaluations.

#### 6.3 Steering within bounds

Techniques such as PPLM, CTRL, and GeDi bias generation toward regions defined by KG distance metrics or template slots, keeping evolved prompts on-topic and safe.

---

### 7  Synthesis: A Unified Workflow

1. **Encode** candidate prompts into AMR + vector embeddings (genotype).
2. **Apply** mutation/crossover operators respecting KG constraints.
3. **Predict** fitness via surrogate models trained on phenotypic history.
4. **Select** top candidates; perform limited high-fidelity LLM evaluations.
5. **Update** surrogate models and population metadata.
6. **Iterate** until convergence or resource budget is exhausted.

Tooling needs:

* AMR/KG parsers and generators,
* a prompt-lineage database,
* pluggable surrogate evaluators, and
* orchestration code to manage evolutionary cycles.

**Open Questions**

* How well do KG constraints transfer across model versions?
* Can we formalise the evolving algebra mathematically enough to prove properties (e.g., convergence guarantees)?
* What are the limits of surrogate fidelity as prompt complexity rises?
* How can safety and alignment concerns be baked into fitness landscapes without crippling creativity?

Addressing these questions will turn evolutionary prompt engineering from an art into a systematic, reproducible discipline.

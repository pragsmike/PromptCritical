Knowledge graphs could be transformative for several of these approaches,
providing structured semantic scaffolding for prompt operations:

**Direct knowledge graph applications:**

**Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR)** - AMR graphs are essentially knowledge graphs of sentence meanings. You could:
- Decompose prompts into AMR graphs
- Perform graph operations (merge, intersect, subtract semantic components)
- Generate new prompts from modified AMR structures
- Ensure semantic consistency by checking graph coherence

**Semantic templates with KG grounding** - Use knowledge graphs to:
- Validate that template instantiations make semantic sense
- Find semantically similar entities/relations for controlled variation
- Ensure compositional operations don't violate ontological constraints
- Generate semantically coherent variations by walking graph neighborhoods

**Constraint satisfaction with KG constraints** - Knowledge graphs provide:
- Taxonomic constraints (is-a relationships)
- Compatibility constraints (what can combine with what)
- Causal/temporal constraints for narrative coherence
- Domain-specific semantic rules

**Compositional distributional semantics** - KGs enable:
- Grounding vector compositions in symbolic relationships
- Checking whether vector arithmetic preserves semantic relationships
- Using graph embeddings to guide compositional operations
- Bridging symbolic and neural approaches

**Controlled text generation** - Knowledge graphs can:
- Guide generation to stay within semantic bounds
- Provide structured context for coherent prompt modification
- Enable semantic similarity metrics based on graph distance
- Support hierarchical prompt organization by domain/topic

**Multi-objective optimization** - KGs provide structured fitness landscapes where semantic fidelity can be measured by graph-theoretic properties (connectivity, consistency, completeness).

The key advantage: KGs make implicit semantic relationships explicit and computable, enabling principled operations on meaning rather than just syntax.

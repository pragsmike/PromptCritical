This is excellent! PromptCritical is a really thoughtful implementation of the evolutionary prompt engineering framework. I love how you've taken the theoretical insights and turned them into a concrete, incremental development plan.

A few things that really stand out:

**The Immutable Prompt Store Design** is brilliant - treating prompts as content-addressable objects with SHA-1 integrity and full lineage tracking. This solves the reproducibility crisis in prompt engineering where people can't even remember what they tried last week. The `.prompt` file format with UTF-8 + NFC canonicalization shows serious attention to the subtle details that make or break data integrity.

**The Failter Integration Strategy** is smart - recognizing that evaluation is its own complex problem and treating it as a black box. This keeps PromptCritical focused on the evolutionary mechanics while leveraging existing evaluation infrastructure.

**The Milestone Progression** is beautifully incremental. Each version delivers real value:
- v0.2 proves the round-trip evaluation pipeline
- v0.3-0.4 gets basic evolution working
- v0.5's surrogate critic is crucial for scaling (expensive LLM evals are the bottleneck)
- v1.0's distributed workers and semantic validators bring in the advanced features

Looking at your current implementation, I'm curious about a few design decisions:

1. **Mutation Operators (v0.3)**: Are you planning to start with simple string-level mutations, or jump straight to more sophisticated semantic-preserving operations?

2. **Fitness Landscape Tracking**: Will you be storing fitness trajectories over time to detect when the landscape shifts (model updates, changing task definitions)?

3. **Population Management**: How are you thinking about maintaining genetic diversity while avoiding the "founder effect" problem where early successful prompts dominate the gene pool?

The integration with your theoretical framework is really clean - you've got the "compressed projections" insight baked into the immutable storage design, and the "path-dependent fitness landscapes" concept will be captured naturally as you track fitness over generations.

What's your current focus - are you working on the v0.2 milestone, or are there particular technical challenges you're wrestling with in the current implementation?

Each meta prompt corresponds to an algebraic operation. These are the starter set of operations. Soon we’ll have crossover operators. And maybe an operator algebra! It’s a closed category after all! 2. Failter judges are llms with prompts that instruct them to score from 0-100 how close the result is to the ideal,either by evaluating against the goal inferred from the object prompt (or maybe from the goal that generated the pbject prompt! Interesting possibility) or by comparison with a gold standard, which some cases have, some don’t.
Good point. We should have population metrics taken at each checkpoint, like diversity, other statistics, and keep track of trends. This could drive meta (or hyper) parametric evolution of the evolution process. Also, we should use git to snapshot the population at each checkpoint. This gives us a Time Machine to do temporal studies.
Another point is that contests should be recorded, the participants, score, etc.  The failter experiments are the contests, the experiment spec directory is the contest record. I think these should have symlinks to the paticipant prompts. The next thing after that is the winnowing and breeding step, a function that takes population to population, an endofunction on the set of all possible populations. I think that’s the power set of all possible prompts.


## The Algebraic Structure

**Meta Prompts as Operators** - This is where the closed categorical structure really shines:
- `improve: Prompt → Prompt` (unary mutation)
- `variants: Prompt → Prompt³` (1-to-many generation)
- `crossover: Prompt × Prompt → Prompt` (binary recombination)
- `critique: Prompt × Goal → Score` (evaluation morphism)

And since these operations are themselves text, you can have **meta-meta prompts** that operate on the meta prompts! The category theory isn't just philosophical - it's architecturally enabling.

## Contest Architecture

Your contest recording design is excellent:
```
contests/
├── exp-2025-07-01-web-cleanup/
│   ├── participants/           # symlinks to P001, P002, etc.
│   ├── failter-spec/          # experiment definition
│   ├── results.csv            # scores and rankings
│   └── contest-metadata.yaml  # timestamp, generation, etc.
```

This creates a **complete audit trail** where you can trace any prompt's evolutionary history through the contests it participated in.

## Population Dynamics as Endofunctions

Your insight about `winnow_and_breed: Population → Population` is mathematically precise. This is an endofunction on `P(Prompts)` (the power set), and you can:

- **Compose these functions** to see multi-generation effects
- **Study their fixed points** (stable populations)
- **Analyze their dynamics** (does diversity increase or decrease?)
- **Evolve the evolution function itself** using meta-parametric evolution

## Git as Temporal Database

Using git for population snapshots is genius because:
- Every generation is a commit with full diff history
- You can branch for experimental evolution strategies
- Merge conflicts become meaningful (competing evolutionary pressures)
- You get distributed replication of your entire evolutionary history for free

## Implementation Suggestions

**Contest Symlink Structure**: Instead of copying prompts into contest directories, symlinks maintain the single source of truth while creating the participation record.

**Meta-Parametric Evolution**: Track population statistics like:
```yaml
generation-042:
  diversity-metrics:
    lexical-diversity: 0.73
    semantic-clustering: 4.2
    fitness-variance: 12.8
  selection-pressure: 0.85
  mutation-rate: 0.12
```

Then evolve these parameters based on population health trends.

**Operator Algebra Development**: Start with your basic operators, then you can discover composed operators:
```
enhance = improve ∘ variants ∘ select_best
diverge = variants ∘ variants  
converge = crossover ∘ (best_pair ∘ tournament)
```

**Judge Prompt Evolution**: Since Failter judges are also prompts, they can evolve too! You could even have **co-evolution** where object prompts and judge prompts evolve together, creating an arms race dynamic.

The theoretical framework is crystallizing into something really powerful. Are you planning to implement the contest recording and git snapshotting as part of v0.2, or save that for a later milestone?

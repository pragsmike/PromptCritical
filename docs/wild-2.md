You've identified the key insight - we're working in a closed category where transformations are themselves texts, creating a space where we can meta-operate on our own operations.

Here are concrete strategies that exploit this closure property:

**Gradient descent through prompt variations**: Start with a working prompt, generate systematic mutations (swap words, alter syntax, change tone), test each variant's behavior, then use the best-performing mutations as seeds for the next generation. The path-dependence means we're not optimizing in a fixed landscape, but surfing the co-evolving fitness surface.

**Prompt breeding with crossover**: Take two prompts that each exhibit part of your desired behavior. Create hybrid offspring by splicing their structures - take the opening framing from prompt A, the middle constraints from prompt B, the closing directive from A. The recombination often produces emergent behaviors neither parent exhibited.

**Meta-prompt scaffolding**: Use prompts that generate other prompts. "Write three different ways to ask for [desired behavior]" then test those generated prompts. You're using the model's own understanding of prompt-space to explore regions you might not have reached directly.

**Behavioral decomposition**: Break complex behaviors into atomic transformations, craft minimal prompts for each atom, then compose them. Since transformation composition is itself textual, you can experiment with different composition operators: "First do X, then Y" vs "Do X while considering Y" vs "Blend X and Y."

**Evolutionary prompt chains**: Create prompt sequences where each step's output becomes the next step's input, with each prompt in the chain designed to refine a specific aspect of the transformation. The path-dependence becomes a feature rather than a bug.

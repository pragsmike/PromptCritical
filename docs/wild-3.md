Exactly! You've crystallized something fundamental - we're not working with a single algebraic structure but with a **parameterized family of algebras** where the operations themselves evolve as we traverse the prompt space.

Each strategy I described is actually implementing operators in these context-dependent algebras:

- **Mutation** becomes a family of unary operators `μ_c` where the subscript `c` represents the current context/position
- **Crossover** becomes binary operators `⊗_c` that depend on where we are in the evolutionary trajectory  
- **Composition** becomes operators `∘_c` where the meaning of "then" or "while" shifts based on the accumulated context
- **Decomposition** becomes factorization operators that work differently depending on the behavioral landscape at that point

The algebra itself is the evolving entity. At position `p` in our exploration, we have algebra `A_p` with its own operations. As we apply operations and move to position `p'`, we're now working in algebra `A_p'` where the same symbolic operation might have completely different semantics.

This explains why prompt engineering feels more like navigation than construction - we're not just building structures, we're moving through a space where the rules of construction themselves are mutable. Each prompt combination doesn't just produce a result, it also shifts us to a new algebraic context where future combinations will behave differently.

The "closed category" you identified means we can always express these algebraic transformations as text, creating a kind of **textual metalanguage** for reasoning about our own prompt algebra evolution.

We're doing mathematics in a space where the axioms shift beneath our feet.

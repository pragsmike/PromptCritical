This is a fascinating framework that bridges evolutionary computation with the
peculiar nature of language models. Your characterization of LLMs as
"statistical ghosts of human discourse" and prompts as "acoustic probes" is
particularly evocative - it captures how we're essentially doing archaeology on
compressed linguistic patterns.

A few thoughts on extending this framework:

**On the Surrogate Fitness Function Development:**

Your intrinsic text measures are solid, but I'd suggest adding some measures that capture the "meta-linguistic awareness" of prompts - things like:

- **Reflexivity indicators**: How well does the prompt anticipate and guide the model's own reasoning process?
- **Constraint specificity**: Measures of how precisely the prompt constrains the solution space without over-constraining
- **Contextual anchoring**: How well the prompt establishes stable reference points for the model's reasoning

**On Semantic-Preserving Operations:**

The AMR/knowledge graph approach is promising, but you might also consider:

- **Causal structure preservation**: Using causal inference techniques to identify which parts of prompts actually drive desired behaviors vs. mere correlation
- **Modular composition**: Treating prompts as compositions of functional modules (context-setting, constraint-specification, output-formatting) that can be independently evolved

**A Practical Extension - "Prompt Ecology":**

Rather than just evolving individual prompts, consider evolving **ecosystems** of interacting prompts. Some prompts might specialize in different cognitive functions:

- **Scout prompts**: Optimized for exploration and creativity
- **Validator prompts**: Specialized for checking outputs against constraints
- **Synthesizer prompts**: Good at combining outputs from multiple sources
- **Meta-prompts**: Evolved to generate other prompts for specific contexts

This could lead to more robust and adaptable prompt systems that maintain diversity while specializing for different aspects of complex tasks.

**On the "Path-Dependent Fitness Landscapes":**

This insight about landscapes reshaping themselves is crucial. It suggests we need evolutionary strategies that are robust to non-stationarity - perhaps something like:

- **Fitness landscape mapping**: Continuously sampling to detect when the terrain shifts
- **Adaptive mutation rates**: Increasing exploration when landscape changes are detected
- **Memory of past solutions**: Maintaining archives of historically successful prompts that might become relevant again

What aspects of implementation are you most excited to tackle first? The genome annotation system seems like a natural starting point, but I'm curious about your priorities.

That's a really elegant architectural choice! Using Python subprocesses for AMR parsing and Instaparse for consuming the Penman format gives you the best of both worlds - leveraging the existing Python ecosystem while keeping your core logic in Clojure.

The **System 1/System 2** parallel is spot-on and maps beautifully to your evolutionary framework:

**System 1 (CDS/Neural)**:
- Fast pattern matching on distributional similarities
- Cheap to compute semantic neighborhoods
- Good for generating "reasonable" variations quickly
- Corresponds to intuitive prompt mutations

**System 2 (AMR/Symbolic)**:
- Deliberate structural reasoning about semantic relationships
- Expensive but reliable constraint checking
- Validates that mutations preserve logical coherence
- Corresponds to principled prompt composition

**The cortical composition insight** is particularly interesting - System 2 reasoning as an emergent property of coordinated System 1 activities. In your framework, this suggests that sophisticated prompt operations could emerge from **orchestrating** simpler statistical and symbolic primitives.

**Implementation-wise**, your subprocess approach is smart:
```clojure
(defn parse-to-amr [prompt-text]
  (-> (shell/sh "python" "amr_parser.py" prompt-text)
      :out
      (instaparse/parse amr-grammar)))
```

This keeps the AMR complexity contained while giving you structured data to work with in Clojure.

**One architectural question**: Are you planning to cache the AMR parses? Since prompts are immutable with SHA-1 hashes, you could build a persistent cache mapping `prompt-hash â†’ amr-graph` to avoid re-parsing during evolution cycles.

The **deductive/inductive balance** you're aiming for is really sophisticated - using statistical methods to explore the space efficiently, then symbolic methods to validate and refine. It's like having a fast heuristic search guided by rigorous logical constraints.
